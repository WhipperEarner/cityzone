Responsive Website for a DSD Business

I am building a responsive website and in the process, I'm implementing new ideas as i go. The corrosponding css pages are not in great order, as I'm focusing on the bigger picture on hand.

My goal is to include technologies as I develop addational pages to complete the website. I'm sure I'll face challanges and roadblocks, as I undertake this task part- time; However, I'm also determined to learn new ideas and ovecome those challanges through trial and error.
